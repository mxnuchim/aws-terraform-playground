Each directory may contain:

- Notes
- Example Terraform configs
- Experiments
- Observations

---

## Standards Followed Here

- Providers are version-constrained
- Lock file is committed
- No open-ended `>=` in production examples
- Resources destroyed after practice
- Authentication methods documented explicitly
- No reliance on “latest”

---

## If I Ever Teach This (At an Event/Workshop)

This repository is already structured like modular lecture notes:

- Fundamentals first
- Then provider internals
- Then authentication and resource provisioning
- Then state management
- Then production patterns

Each day builds on the previous one.

The goal would not be to teach syntax —
but to teach infrastructure thinking.

---

## Final Notes

Terraform is not just a tool.
It is a reliability discipline.

AWS is not just a console.
It is an API surface.

Infrastructure is not just provisioning.
It is lifecycle management.

This repo documents that mindset.
